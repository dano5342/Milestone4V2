## Overview
This website is inspired by Ebay as an e-commerce website - with a twist. This project is going to be built purely upon historical artifacts of myth and legend, with maybe a few actual items thrown in as well. This website will be intended for collectors and sellers as will be storied upon below in my UX section. Think of these items as an offshoot of the old Catholic way of buying into heaven by way of [Indulgences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence).

## UX
The website will be focussed on a few different users which shall be expanded upon below.
1. `New User` On happenstance has found the website through a search engine via optimised keywords - This new user wants to know what the site is for, what they can achieve via registering to the site and what is on offer. Nothing too obtrusive and they can browse at their leisure and be walked through the auctions through categories and tags.
2. `Previous User` Has been on the site for a while now, has an account and han't yet made any sales or purchases, and via luck has come accross a Splinter from the Lance of St. George - Thus he would like to make some money via an auction. Understanding this he places the item for sale with a time limit of 2 weeks and also a `Buy it!` limit of £1500. Starting the auction at £499 to entice people to go above and beyond the `Buy it!` price.
3. `Collector` This user is the main Target audience for the website, this user wants to be able to review all things within certain categories and then make purchases from within them. Storing things as they go along in their cart until ready for order. They also arent sure how trustworthy some sellers are as they had a bad experience with one previously! So they would like the ability to view reviews of the person/shop they may be buying from and also leave a review for an item that they purchased from this seller.

## Features
The premise of the website was originally to be an Ecommerce/Auction website for user to user interaction with sales ran by users kind of like an Ebay application. However throughout the course of development and for the purpose of marking the website I cut down the scope and decided to go for a simpler approach with the same kind of ideas as before.

The site was therefore changed into a more conventional project along the lines of etsy or an Asos store, with login/logout functionality, the ability to peruse and purchase items securely using Stripe integrated into the app with JS and on the backend. 

Some base features:
+ Account CRUD functionality
+ Browsing and filtering products by category, filter by search and by details
+ Storing products in the session for return users and for new users.
+ Authentication required for purchasing products from the site.

## Technologies
This project will make use of a collection of tech's that I've used so far through my course.
+ [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) - For writing the templates in which each view will be written HTML the language of the web will be utilised.
+ [SCSS / CSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Compiling my stles from Sassy CSS into CSS will help to minimise the amount of coding necessary in the styling of the website.
+ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For minimising the amount of custom coding necessary within the project this will be used for the grid and layout.
+ [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - This will be used for making the website more interactive for the user and making it more appealing to the eye via DOM manipulation.
+ [Python Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Python highend language will be used for writing tests, views, urls and linking the backend up to the front end. This will be achieved with Django templating framework.
+ [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) / [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - Will be used for my database in the back end. Postgres will be used for the heroku hosting and SQLite will be used for testing the site before deployment.
+ [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) Travis is a tool for Continuous Integration and helped with a large part of developing the project, used to help test functionality.
+ [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) Is a cloud hosting platform for hosting projects and web applications. I have used Heroku to display and host my project.
+ [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html) I've used Amazons Web Services to hsot my static and my media files. The S3 Buckets allows a user to create a storage elsewhere and call it from the site from environment variables.
+ [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
## Testing
All unit testing was completed using the built in `python manage.py test` command working through each app for the django project, you can find
the tests written for each app under the 'appname'/'testing' folders, each test suite is written for the views, forms and models of each section. Further testing information can be 
[found here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/testing/advanced/)
Coverage was also used to help attain near 100% completion. If there was anything particularly 
challenging on something that required a lot of testing it will be written up below however if nothing out of the ordinary
comes up then the unit tests passed correctly and didnt require any further testing for the purposes of the project.

Unit Testing the products section was one of the more typical TDD testing I have written, creating the test for the detailed view for the product was very typical, writing the minimal amount of code per run to try and make it pass each time, until it does. Here is a detailed write up:
+ I began this particular test trying to just access the product itself whilst writing it up
``` python
class TestProductPages(TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = Client()
        ....
def test_detail_prod_view(self):
        product = Product(title = 'TestProd')
        product.save()
        page = self.client.get('/products/more_info/{0}'.format(id))
        self.assertEqual(page.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(page, 'prod_detail.html')
```

+ This resulted in the following problem: `self.assertEqual(page.status_code, 200) AssertionError: 404 != 200`
+ So through this I figured that the 404 was due to the ID not being formatted correctly and amended my code like so:
``` python
def test_detail_prod_view(self):
        product = Product(title = 'TestProd',
                          pk = id)
        product.save()
        page = self.client.get('/products/more_info/{0}'.format(id))
        self.assertEqual(page.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(page, 'prod_detail.html')
``` 
+ The eagle eyed viewer may realise this resulted in a syntax error.
Next I tried to create the product while calling the id:
```python
def test_detail_prod_view(self):
        product = Product(title = 'TestProd')
        product.save()
        id = product.id
        page = self.client.get('/products/more_info/{0}'.format(id))
        self.assertEqual(page.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(page, 'prod_detail.html')
```
+ This then resulted in the following error: `django.db.utils.IntegrityError: NOT NULL constraint failed: products_product.price`
+ So this got me thinking that in my DB There was another relational object that needed calling for this test to pass: the category so this resulted in the following code:
```python
def test_detail_prod_view(self):
    #Creating the category object before calling it from the product.
        cat = Category(category="testCat")
        cat.save()

        product = Product(title = 'TestProd',
                          price = 24,
                          category = cat)
        product.save()
        id = product.id
        page = self.client.get('/products/more_info/{0}'.format(id))
        self.assertEqual(page.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(page, 'prod_detail.html')
```
#### Checkout Issues
During my struggles to write the stripe code into the project I utilised the builtin Python DeBugger (PDB) tool to help print to the console what was being held in the app at the time, this helped to differentiate between bools and functions whilst getting lost in the code. The PDB tool can be used whilst running the application by using the `set_trace()` function on an object to see whats going on. More info on [PDB can be found here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)
#### Continuous Integration
Throughout the development of the project after setting up Heroku, TRAVIS CI tool was utilised to ensure that the builds would be runnable on the Heroku Application, the commands for this are contained within the Travis.yml file above.

#### User Stories


#### Additional Testing Notes
* During Development the creation of models allows for declaring these as `__str__` objects, allowing the administrators to access these through the database backend. This was also used for testing that products and categories. etc were working.
* [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/) Was also utilised for seeing what my unit testing coverage managed, it's at 82% and I'm extremely pleased with this amount, its enough to show that full testing has been done and its not over the top at 100% to show that too much time was spent testing before deploying the app.


## Deployment
I've deployed the website on the cloud hosting platform Heroku, as mentioned above this platform is great for new developers wanting to showcase an application or website that also utilises a backend data set for manipulation on the frontent. 

#### Deploying Locally:
To deploy this project locally you will need one of the following installed on your machine:
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* Or alternatively you can Fork/Clone this project into a new repository and run it through [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)


You will need to also install the following to ensure that you are able to work with the project:
* [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

If you are unfamiliar with any of these take some time to go through the documentation to figure out If you will need to setup any       `alias commands` to set up `python` as the default python3.8 command, otherwise you WILL need to run `python3` everytime below that python is mentioned.

##### Setup:
1. `git clone https://github.com/dano5342/Milestone4V2` this repository from the command line into your IDE or save a ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/dano5342/Milestone4V2) and use the green button to download the files.
2. From your IDE, direct your workspace here so that you'll be able to manipulate the files A. From the command terminal and B. in your text editor.
3. This is where the aforementioned [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) comes in handy, this is a tool for blocking off all the background noise from your machine and lets you install all the packages required for running the application without any interference from anything else. the command for this is `python -m venv "NAME OF YOUR VirtualENV"` 

This next point will have two versions, one for MAC users and one for Windows.


4. For windows to activate the venv you'll need to run `.\\Scripts\activate` (This will need to be done from the main library folder that contains the `Scripts` folder).   // For Mac Users this command is `source "NAMEOFVENV"/bin/activate`
5. Run the local install command from this repo's requirements.txt MAC: `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` For windows this is `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. You'll need to now create a new folder within the top level of this project (the main file), I usually name this file `env.py` for simplicity sake, however you can on a mac/linux use a .bashrc or .bashprofile file to manipulate these variables. Within this folder you will need to write the following code:

```python 
import os


os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY')
os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE', 'STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY') #<-- Stripe
os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_SECRET', 'YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', 'HEROKU_POSTGRES_CREATED_DB_URL')# <-- Heroku
os.environ.setdefault('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY')# <-- AWS
os.environ.setdefault('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_USER', 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS') # <-- Gmail SMTP
os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_PASS', 'YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD')
```
Legend: 
        
Stripe: A stripe account is required, please follow this [guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=stripe+documentation+python&rlz=1C1CHWA_enGB604GB604&oq=stripe+documentation+python&aqs=chrome..69i57.3483j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to ensure you have this correctly set up.
        
        
Heroku: An account is required with Heroku for this to work, during the deployment of the website make sure to go to the projects page on Heroku and set up the Postgres resource.
        
        
AWS: An AWS account will be required for this, along with bucket access and S3 for keychain access, please follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html) for full information on how to set this up. 
        
GMAIL SMTP: For sending EMAILS within this app to users, you will require an email account with GMAIL for this version of the app, this guide [here](https://medium.com/@_christopher/how-to-send-emails-with-python-django-through-google-smtp-server-for-free-22ea6ea0fb8e) shows you how to setup the mailing from the app to the user, and [this one here](https://devanswers.co/create-application-specific-password-gmail/) allows you to setup your Gmail from applications


7. With all of this setup, and with any luck you should be able to run this following command: `python manage.py makemigrations` If this step works, run `python manage.py migrate` This will allow you access to the data models on the backend and creates a new file db.sqlite3 in your workspace. However if the first command has not worked, make sure that in `settings.py` this is true: `DEBUG: True`
8. Providing all this has worked, you should now be able to create an adminstrator for the application, you can do this by running `python manage.py createsuperuser` Follow the terminal line text to see what to do next. Following the setup of this user, you can now run the project!
9. Finally run `python manage.py runserver` To run the webapp locally on your machine.
